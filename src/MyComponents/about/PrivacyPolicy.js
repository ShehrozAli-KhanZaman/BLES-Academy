      <p>
        Welcome to BLES ACADEMY. We are committed to protecting your privacy and
        ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and
        responsible manner.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Privacy Principles</h2>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy is fueled by our commitment to these Privacy
        Principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We’re deeply committed to creating a safe and secure online
          environment for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We
          established BLES ACADEMY as a nonprofit organization so that our
          mission of education and your trust will not be in conflict with a
          for-profit motive.
        </li>
        <li>
          We strive to provide you with access to and control over the
          information you give us, and we take the protection of your
          information very seriously.
        </li>
        <li>
          We take extra precautions for our younger learners as described in our
          Children’s Privacy Notice, including restricting child accounts to
          automatically block features that would allow a child to post or
          disclose personal information.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not display third-party advertising on BLES ACADEMY. Our mission
          is to provide you with a world-class education, not to sell you
          products.
        </li>
      </ul>

        information.
